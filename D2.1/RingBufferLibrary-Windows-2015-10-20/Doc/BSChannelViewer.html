<h2>Android App BSChannelViewer</h2>

<p>This document describes a sample Android client App <em>BSChannelViewer</em>.
It is intended as a proof of concept to illustrate what can be done with the
2015 <em>RingBuffer</em> library's client/server sample streaming feature.
For full details on how to setup a server to communicate with this client
see <a href="TryClientServer.html" target=_blank">Try Client/Server</a>.
</p>
<p>The main screen displayed by this App is shown here, in portrait orientation
mode:</p>

<img SRC="device-2015-07-01-194152.png" alt="Main Screen" width=400 height=640>

<h4>Lower or Right Display Panel</h4>

<p>The lower (or right in landscape mode) part of the screen provides a continuous
trace of one of the channels being sampled on the server computer.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Channel selection.<br>
	<p>The channel being displayed can be stepped numerically by using <em>fling</em>
	gestures over the display panel; right-to-left steps the channel number up,
	left-to-right steps down.</p>

<p>The channel being displayed can also be chosen more directly by touching the
desired channel in the top (or left in landscape mode) window.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Amplitude scale.<br>
<p>The trace window can be re-scaled in amplitude by using a <em>double tap</em> gesture
in the panel.  Each <em>double tap</em> steps through a set of defined amplitude
scales.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Time scale.<br>
<p>The time scale can be changed by using two fingers and moving them horizontally
closer or farther apart.  This steps through a set of defined time
scales.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Pause updates.<br>
<p>Screen updates can be paused by using a <em>fling down</em> gesture.
Use a <em>fling up</em> to restart updates.</p>
</li>
	<li>Title line.<br>
	<p>The title line above the trace panel displays:
	<ul>
		<li>The number of channels being sampled on the server.</li>
		<li>The approximate rate at which the server's Usb "ring buffer" is being filled, in samples/channel/second.</li>
		<li>The channel being plotted.</li>
		<li>The set of channels currently being transferred from the server.</li>
		<li>The current rate at which samples are being received by this client, in samples/channel/second.</li>
		<li>The number of re-syncs performed, usually due to limited bandwidth.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>The main screen displayed by this App is shown here, with "cap" electrodes
displayed, in landscape orientation
mode:</p>

<img SRC="device-2015-07-01-194243.png" alt="Main Screen" width=640 height=400>

<h4>Upper or Left Display Panel</h4>

<p>The upper (or left) display shows channel offsets for the channels currently being
transferred from the server.  This display is similar to the channel offset display
in <em>ActiView</em>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Channel selection.<br>
	<p>If you touch a channel that is not being transferred (and
displayed), a new set of channels is requested from the server and that channel
becomes the channel displayed in the lower (or right) trace panel.</p>
</li>
<li>Amplitude scale.<br>
<p>The display can be re-scaled by using a <em>double tap</em> gesture in the
window.</p>
</li>
<li>Cap layout.<br>
<p>The upper (or left) display can be changed to a "cap layout" display by touching the
"head" icon in the upper right corner of the screen.  In the "cap" display, channel
offset is indicated by a colour ring around the electrode.  Again, only the channels
currently being transmitted from the server have this ring.</p>
</li>
<li>Channel selection.<br>
<p>If you touch an electrode that is not being transferred, a new set of channels is
requested from the server and that electrode (channel) is displayed in the lower
(or right) panel.</p>
</li>
<li>Magnification.<br>
<p>This display can be magnified by using a <em>double tap</em> gesture.
When magnified, the window can be scrolled by moving a finger around on the
display.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The main screen displayed by this App is shown here, with "cap" electrodes
labeled rather than numbered, in landscape orientation mode:</p>

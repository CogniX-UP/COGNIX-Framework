<h4>Preample</h4>

<p>"RingBuffer" is the new name for the BioSemi library that was formerly called "Labview_DLL".
The new name was chosen to remove any inference that the library comes from or, is dependent on, the
National Instruments "LabVIEW" product.</p>

<p>This software contains no kernel mode routines and runs entirely
in user mode.  
</p>

<p>The BioSemi Linux software is distributed here in both prebuilt binary
form - for Intel Linux 6.5 and later - and with a Makefile so that it
can be rebuild to run with updated components.</p>

<p>The low level software needed to access the USB sample
stream generated by the BioSemi acquisition hardware consists of 2 libraries:
<ul>
<li>1. "libusb-1.0" to control of the USB device
(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb">
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb</a>).<br>
The "libusb-1.0" package has the "GNU Lesser General Public License"
(or "LGPL") which means it must be distributed in source form.
At present most Linux distributions have a "libusb" library readily
available.
</li>
<br>
<li>2. "libRingBuffer" to control the continuous filling of a sample
ring buffer.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Prebuild binary files are located in the "Linux32" and
"Linux64" subdirectories.  The first set of instructions below give
the steps required to use these pre-built binary files, see
<a href="#quick">Quick Start</a>.</p>

<p>If these binary files don't work, try rebuilding them from the
available source, see
<a href="#slow">Slower Start</a>.</p>

<a name="quick"></a>
<h4>Quick Start (for when "libusb" may be already installed)</h4>

<ul>
<li>1. Open a "Terminal" window and "cd" to the "RingBufferLibrary-Linux" directory.</li>
<br>

<li>2. Choose a 32 or 64 bit test by doing either "cd Linux32" or "cd Linux64".<br>
The choice should be determined by the bit-width of the acquisition application
you intend to run.
</li>
<br>

<li>3. Add the current directory to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH with command:
<pre>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`:`pwd`.lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>
Note: Including the ".lib" reference is harmless if it is not needed.</li>
<br>

<li>4. Plug the Biosemi Receiver's USB cable into the computer and run the test program:
<pre>
./RingBuffer_SyncTest
</pre>

Use CTRL-C to stop the test.  See the
<a href="#syncusage">RingBuffer_SyncTest Usage</a>
section below for more information about this program.

<p>If you get this message:
<ul>
<li>"./RingBuffer_SyncTest: error while loading shared libraries: RingBuffer.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"<br>
<br>
this means that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not set correctly or some other library was not found.
Use the command "ldd RingBuffer_SyncTest" to determine which library can't be found.
If it is "libusb" that is missing, perform the
<a href="#slow">Slower Start</a>
section below.
If it is some other library, try doing the
<a href="#build">Build the test program</a>
step below.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If you get this message:
<ul>
<li>"libusb couldn't open USB device /proc/bus/usb/001/009: Permission denied.<br>
libusb requires write access to USB device nodes.<br>
Could not find/open Biosemi device<br>
No USB driver found<br>
Can't open device driver!"<br>
<br>
go to the
<a href="#usbaccess">USB Access Permissions</a>
section below.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</ul>

<p>If the program runs without reporting errors, a more permanent location for library
"libRingBuffer" would remove the need to repeatedly modify "LD_LIBRARY_PATH".
One possibility is to put the library in "/usr/local/lib" and  make sure that
/etc/ld.so.conf contains the line:
<pre>
/usr/local/lib
</pre>
</p>

<p>Once this test program works, follow the instructions in
<a href="TryClientServer.html" target=_blank">Try Client/Server</a>
if you want to try the client/server mode of operation.
</p>

<p>Some performance improvement may be gained by using the library
parameters explained at
<a href="Tuning.html" target=_blank">Tuning</a>.</p>

<a name="slow"></a>
<h4>Slower Start (for when "libusb" is missing)</h4>

<p>
For this install you will need the Linux Development Tools package.
If the tools are not already installed, the command to do this on
RedHat, CentOS and similar systems is:
<pre>
yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
</pre>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a "Terminal" window and "cd" to the "RingBufferLibrary-Linux" directory.</li>
<br>

<li>Choose a 32 or 64 bit test by doing either "cd Linux32" or "cd Linux64".<br>
The choice should be determined by the bit-width of the acquisition application
you intend to run.
</li>
<br>

<li>Locate library "libusb".<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li>Most Linux distributions now have a "libusb" library readily available.
To check if this library is already installed on your system, use
<ul>
<li>on RedHat, CentOS and similar systems:
<pre>
"yum info libusb.x86_64" (for the 64 bit version)
"yum info libusb.i686" (for the 32 bit version)
</pre>
</li>

<li>on Debian, Ubuntu and similar systems:
<pre>
"apt-get policy libusb.x86_64" (for the 64 bit version)
"apt-get policy libusb.i686" (for the 32 bit version)
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>If the "libusb" library is not already installed it can usually be
installed using,
<ul>
<li>on RedHat, CentOS and similar systems:
<pre>
"yum install libusb.x86_64" (for 64 bit)
"yum install libusb.i686" (for 32 bit)
</pre>
</li>

<li>on Debian, Ubuntu and similar systems:
<pre>
"apt-get install libusb.x86_64" (for 64 bit)
"apt-get install libusb.i686" (for 32 bit)
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li>If "libusb-1.0" is not available for your Linux distribution, or
if you have any trouble using the installed version, a private copy
of "libusb-1.0" can be compiled from the source code.  Otherwise
skip ahead to the
<a href="#test">Test your installation</a>
step.</li>
<br>

<li><a name="compile"></a>Compile a private 'libusb'.<br>

<p>For your convenience the source code for version "libusb-1.0.19"
(the latest, May 2015) is included in this download.  Newer versions
may be available at the web address
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb">http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb</a>.
</p>

<p>To do this compile you need appropriate (32 or 64 bit) versions of
"glibc-devel" and "libgcc" installed on your system: "glibc-devel.i686"
and "libgcc.i686" for 32 bit or "glibc-devel.x86_64" and "libgcc.x86_64"
for 64 bit.</p>

<p>To compile the included copy of "libusb" use this command:
<pre>
. ./compile_libusb.sh
</pre>
The compile will create two new subdirectories (lib and include).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li><a name="test"></a>Test your installation<br>
<p>Use the supplied test program
"RingBuffer_SyncTest".</p>

<p>This program must be able to find the two shared libraries, "libRingBuffer"
and "libusb".  The following command will add two possible locations to
the library search list:
<pre>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`:`pwd`.lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>
Note: Including the ".lib" reference is harmless if it is not needed.</p>

<p>To run the test program, plug the Biosemi Receiver's USB cable into
the computer and type:
<pre>
./RingBuffer_SyncTest
</pre>
Use CTRL-C to stop the test.  See the
<a href="#syncusage">RingBuffer_SyncTest Usage</a>
section below for more information about this program.</p>

<p>If you get this message:
<ul>
<li>"./RingBuffer_SyncTest: error while loading shared libraries: RingBuffer.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"<br>
<br>
this usually means that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not set correctly.
Use the command "ldd RingBuffer_SyncTest" to determine which library
can't be found.  If it is "libusb" that is missing, try performing the
<a href="#compile">Compile a private 'libusb'</a>
step above if you haven't already.
If it is some other library, try performing the
<a href="#build">Build the test program</a>
step below.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>If you get this message:
<ul>
<li>"libusb couldn't open USB device /proc/bus/usb/001/009: Permission denied.<br>
libusb requires write access to USB device nodes.<br>
Could not find/open Biosemi device<br>
No USB driver found<br>
Can't open device driver!"<br>
<br>
go to the
<a href="#usbaccess">USB Access Permissions</a>
section below.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If the supplied version of "RingBuffer_SyncTest" just won't run on your
Linux version, try doing the 
<a href="#build">Build the test program</a>
step below and then repeat
this
<a href="#test">Test your installation</a>
step.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If the program runs without reporting errors, a more permanent location for library
"libRingBuffer" (and "libusb" if you had to build your own copy) would remove the
need to repeatedly modify "LD_LIBRARY_PATH".  One possibility is to put the library
(or libraries) in "/usr/local/lib" and  make sure that /etc/ld.so.conf contains the
line:
<pre>
/usr/local/lib
</pre>
</p>

<p>Once this test program works, follow the instructions in
<a href="TryClientServer.html" target=_blank">Try Client/Server</a>
if you want to try the client/server mode of operation.
</p>

<p>Some performance improvement may be gained by using the library
parameters explained at
<a href="Tuning.html" target=_blank">Tuning</a>.</p>


<a name="actiview"></a>
<h4>Merging with ActiView or Other Existing Application</h4>

<p>Note:<br>
<ul>
<li>At present, <em>ActiView for Linux</em> is available on the BioSemi download page:</br>
<a href="http://www.biosemi.com/download.htm">
http://www.biosemi.com/download.htm</a></li>
<br>
<li>ActiView707 requires that these National Instruments packages be installed:<br>
labview-rte-aal-1.1-1.i386.rpm and labview85-rte-8.5-1.i386.rpm<br>
See: <a href="http://www.ni.com/download/labview-run-time-engine-8.5/868/en/">
http://www.ni.com/download/labview-run-time-engine-8.5/868/en/</a>
</li>
<br>
<li>The location of the LabView run time engine must be added to the library search path:
<pre>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
</pre>
</li>

<li>If running on a 64 bit Linux system, some additional 32 bit
packages may need to be installed.  On our 64 bit CentOS 6.5,
the command,
<pre>
ldd /usr/local/lib/liblvrt.so.8.5
</pre>
showed that libGL.so.1, libX11.so.6 and libXext.so.6 were
missing.  This command:
<pre>
yum whatprovides libGL.so.1
</pre>
showed that "mese-libGL-10.1.2-2.e16.i686" was needed.
Using this command:
<pre>
sudo yum install mesa-libGL-10.1.2-2.e16.i686
</pre>
and repeating the above "ldd" command showed that all missing packages
were now installed.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>To merge this new <em>libRingBuffer</em> with an existing version of
BioSemi's <em>ActiView</em> program or other existing acquisition application:
<ul>
	<li>Replace the existing library file <em>libRingBuffer.so.0</em> or
	<em>liblabview_dll.so.0</em> (for <em>ActiView</em> usually
	in the "data" directory) with the version from this distribution.<br>
	Be careful to use the bit-width library file that matches the
	application's bit-width.  The "file" command can be used to determine
	a program's bit-width.
	<p>If the application is looking for a <em>liblabview_dll</em>
	library, copy and rename the <em>libRingBuffer</em> file and use
	that instead.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>If <em>libusb</em> is not installed in a system directory,
	replace the library file <em>libusb-1.0.so.0</em>, for
	<em>ActiView</em> usually in the "data" directory, with the version
	from this distribution.
	Again be careful to use the library file with the correct bit-width.
	</li>
<br>
	<li>Insert the parameter file <em>ringbuffer.ini</em>
	from this distribution into the directory containing the
	application file.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="build"></a>
<h4>Build the test program</h4>

<p>To do this you need appropriate (32 or 64 bit) versions of "glibc-devel" and "libgcc"
installed on your system:
<ul>
<li>"glibc-devel.i686" and "libgcc.i686" for 32 bit or</li>
<li>"glibc-devel.x86_64" and "libgcc.x86_64" for 64 bit.</li>
</ul>
Warning: don't do this procedure for both 64 bit and 32 bit software in the same
login session.  This procedure appends to paths defined in the environment.
Serially appending both 64 and 32 bit items to the same environment variables will
cause confusion.</p>

<p>Type "make".</p>

<p>This should build the ring buffer shared library (libRingBuffer) and a test
program (RingBuffer_SyncTest) that uses this library for data acquisition.</p>

<p>If you get this message:<br>
<br>
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lusb-1.0<br>
<br>
this usually means that no version or a wrong version of "libusb-1.0" is installed.  
Versions installed by the "yum" commands above are usually run time versions
of "libusb" and often don't include everything needed to perform a link operation.
Sometimes there are "-devel" versions available to "yum" but, to be sure of what you
are using, the best solution is usually to:
<ul>
	<li>make a private copy of "libusb" as described in the
<a href="#compile">Compile a private 'libusb'</a>
step above</li>
<li>repeat this
<a href="#build">Build the test program</a>
step</li>
<li>perform the
<a href="#test">Test your installation</a>
step above.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="syncusage"></a>
<h4>RingBuffer_SyncTest Usage</h4>

<p>This program checks that the 0xffffff00 sync words appear in all the
right places in the input stream.  It stops with a message if they don't.</p>

<p>There can be 3 command line parameters for this program:
<ul>
	<li>Ring buffer size, in 512 byte units.<br>
Ring buffer size must start with a 'b' or 'B' and is expressed in units
of 512 bytes.  The default if not given is b65536 for 32 Mbytes.
</li>
<br>
	<li>Range of channels to request from a remote sample server.<br>
The range of channels to request from a remote sample server must have a 'r'
or 'R' prefix and be two numbers separated by a '-'.  The default is all
sampled channels.  Note: the sync and status channels are always added.
</li>
<br>
	<li>Time to run.<br>
The time to run is in seconds.  The default if not given is 600 seconds
(10 minutes).  If given as 0 there will be no time limit.
</li>
</ul>
These parameters can be in any order or left out completely.</p>

<p>Hitting CTRL-C when the program is running will stop the run.</p>

<a name="develop"></a>
<h4>Develop a Program</h4>

<p>To develop your own acquisition program using the <em>RingBuffer</em> library,
see
<a href="RingBufferLibrary-API.html" target=_blank">RingBufferLibrary-API</a> for a description
of the API's available.</p>

<p>The distributed software was compiled in both 32 and 64 bit modes
on CentOS 6.5 (Linux 2.6.32) and was tested on CentOS 6.5 and
CentOS 7 (Linux 3.10.0).</p>

<a name="usbaccess"></a>
<h4>USB Access Permissions</h4>

<p>In Linux, USB devices often have ownership and permissions set to
restrict access to "root" only.  This access must be opened
whenever the BioSemi Receiver's cable is plugged into one of
the computer's USB ports.  This will happen automatically once
you add a rule for this.  Newer systems use "udev" or "udevadm"
to do this; older systems use "hotplug".</p>

<a name="udev"></a>
<h5>udev</h5>

<p>After the Biosemi Receiver cable is plugged into a USB port, run
program "lsusb" (on CentOS 5, /sbin/lsusb) to determine the port being used.</p>

<ul>
	<li>For CentOS 6.5, ContOS 7, the lsusb output looks something like this:
<pre>
   Bus 002 Device 010: ID 0547:1005 Anchor Chips, Inc. 
   Bus 006 Device 002: ID 046d:c018 Logitech, Inc. Optical Wheel Mouse
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
   Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
   Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
   Bus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
   Bus 006 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
   Bus 007 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
   Bus 008 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
</pre>
   Look for a device with ID 0547:1005, perhaps also labelled
   "Anchor Chips, Inc.".  Take the bus and device numbers (here
   002 and 010) and use them like this:
<pre>
   dir -l /dev/bus/usb/002/010
</pre>
   The dir output looks something like this:
<pre>
   crw-rw-r--. 1 root root 189, 137 May 13 08:10 /dev/bus/usb/002/010
</pre>
   This shows the BioSemi receiver's USB port's protection settings.
   </li>
   <br>
   <li>On CentOS 5, the lsusb output looks like this:
<pre>
   Bus 003 Device 001: ID 0000:0000 
   Bus 004 Device 001: ID 0000:0000 
   Bus 007 Device 001: ID 0000:0000 
   Bus 005 Device 001: ID 0000:0000 
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000 
   Bus 008 Device 001: ID 0000:0000 
   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000 
   Bus 002 Device 003: ID 0547:1005 Anchor Chips, Inc. 
   Bus 006 Device 001: ID 0000:0000 
   Bus 006 Device 002: ID 046d:c018 Logitech, Inc. Optical Wheel Mouse
</pre>
   Look for a device with ID 0547:1005, perhaps also labelled
   "Anchor Chips, Inc.".  Note the bus and device numbers (here
   002 and 003) and then do this:
<pre>
   dir -l /dev/usb*
</pre>
   In the dir output look for something like this:
<pre>
   crw------- 1 root root 442,     0 May 19 12:12 /dev/usbdev1.1_ep00
   crw------- 1 root root 442,     0 May 19 12:12 /dev/usbdev1.1_ep81

   crw------- 1 root root 442,  8192 May 19 12:12 /dev/usbdev5.1_ep81
</pre>
   The lines containing usbdev2.3 show the protection for the BioSemi
   device's USB port.<br>
   <br>
</ul>
<p>We need world "read+write" access.  The last 3 protection characters give
   world's access rights, here "r--"  (CentOS6.5, CentOS7) or "---" (CentOS5).
   <br>
   To change this we must add a udev rule to open the port whenever the
   BioSemi cable gets plugged in.
   <br>
   To add this rule, follow these steps:
   <br>
<ul>
	   <li>a) As "superuser", create file "/etc/udev/rules.d/60-biosemi.rules"
      containing these 7 lines:
<pre>
SUBSYSTEM!="usb_device", ACTION!="add", GOTO="biosemi_rules_end"
# biosemi usb receiver
ATTR{idVendor}=="0547", ATTR{idProduct}=="1005", MODE="0666"
ATTR{idVendor}=="0547", ATTR{idProduct}=="1005", SYMLINK+="biosemi"
ATTR{idVendor}=="04b4", ATTR{idProduct}=="8613", MODE="0666"
ATTR{idVendor}=="04b4", ATTR{idProduct}=="8613", SYMLINK+="biosemi2"
LABEL="biosemi_rules_end"
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>b) As "superuser", load the new rule changes by using these two commands,<br>
      <br>
      <ul>
	      <li>on CentOS6.5, CentOS7 use:
<pre>
         udevadm control --reload-rules
         udevadm control --start-exec-queue
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>on CentOS5 use:
<pre>
         /sbin/udevcontrol reload_rules
         /sbin/udevstart        (or sometimes: /sbin/start_udev)          
</pre>
	</li>
</ul>
<li>c) Since this change applies only to new events, pull out the BioSemi
USB cable and re-insert it.</li>
<br>
<li>d) Repeat the above "lsusb" and "dir -l" commands to check that the
      world protection characters have changed.  Note: the bus and device
      numbers probably change when the cable is pulled and re-inserted.
      The new output should be something like this:

<h5>hotplug</h5>

<p>An older system that was used for testing runs Redhat AS4,
Linux 2.6.9.  This system uses "hotplug" to control USB access.
To open access to the USB port using "hotplug" perform the following
steps, as "superuser".</p>

<ul>
	<li>1) Create file "/etc/hotplug/usb/usbbiosemi.usermap" containing this
   line:
<pre>
usbbiosemi 0x0003 0x0547 0x1005 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</pre>
   </li>
   <li>2) Create file "/etc/hotplug/usb/usbbiosemi" containing this
   script:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

if [ "${ACTION}" = "add" ] && [ -f "${DEVICE}" ]
then
   chown root "${DEVICE}"
   chgrp root "${DEVICE}"
   chmod 666 "${DEVICE}"
fi
</pre>
   </li>
   <li>3) Make this script file executable with this command:
<pre>
   chmod a+x /etc/hotplug/usb/usbbiosemi 
</pre>
</li>
<li>4) As an ordinary user retry the test program:
<pre>
   ./RingBuffer_SyncTest 0
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
